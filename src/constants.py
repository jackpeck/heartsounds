The S1 and S2 durations are relative constant for all recordings in
the training set. The mean S1 sound duration was 122 ms with ±32 ms
95% confidence interval and the mean S2 sound duration was 92 ms with
±28 ms 95% confidence interval. Therefore, dμS1 and dμS2 were
predetermined as 122 ms and 92 ms.
